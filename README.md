# Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This is a simple website that showcases a collection of recipes. The project is part of my journey in learning web development and is designed to help me understand and apply the basics of HTML.

## Project Description

The Odin Recipes website is a basic website that includes:

- Links to various recipe pages

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

1. **HTML Structure**: Creating and organizing HTML documents, including the use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and other basic elements.
2. **Links**: Implementing internal and external hyperlinks to navigate between different pages and resources.
3. **Images**: Embedding and managing images within the website to enhance visual appeal and context.
